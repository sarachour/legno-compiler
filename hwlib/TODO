### Simple goal

1. Get fanout spec working. Create a configuration for the fanout block.

2. Get the device spec working. Create an adp for the fanout block.

### Goals

1. Given a configured block, generate the grendel script from the configuration only.

2. Use the 'use_block' command to configure the target block. The block parameters and location should be easy to derive from configuration.

3. We should be able to make profiling, calibration, and model databases from spec.

4. Automatically generate profile and use_block statements to calibrate block.
